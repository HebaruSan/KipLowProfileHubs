// Adds TAC Life Support resources to Kip Engineering's Low Profile Station Hubs.
//
// Written by LitaAlto after Cpt. Kipard's specifications
// Edited by Cpt. Kipard
//
// Presumptions: The average station would have three hubs and should have enough life support for six crew over 30 days. 
//               Only large hubs will have life support provisions.
//               The 6-hub, X-hub, and hex-hub will also lack provisions.
//               The T-hub is too small for full life support provisions, and so has half the provisions of the other hubs.
//
// Based on these presumptions and original specs, the large hubs will have provisions for one Kerbal for 80 days, except the T-hub.
// The T-hub has provisions for one Kerbal for 40 days. And of course the 6-hub, X-hub, and hex-hub are empty.
//
// Values determined by the TAC Part Filling Calculator:
//
// http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101280-Tutorial-Spreadsheet-Filling-a-part-with-TAC-Life-Support-Resources
//
// To make the calculator work I presumed the T-hub is 47.32 liters in size, with the other large hubs at 94.64 liters.
// This closely conforms to the presumptions and specs mentioned above.

// Now to add it to hubs that need it.

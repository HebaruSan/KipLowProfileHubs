// Adds IFI Life Support resources to Kip Engineering's Low Profile Station Hubs.
//
// Written by LitaAlto after Cpt. Kipard's specifications
// Edited by Cpt. Kipard
//
// Presumptions: The average station would have three hubs and should have enough life support for six crew over 30 days. 
//               Only large hubs will have life support provisions.
//               The 6-hub, X-hub, and hex-hub will also lack provisions.
//               The T-hub is too small for full life support provisions, and so has half the provisions of the other hubs.

// Now to add it to hubs that need it.
